# Postfix MTA driver for GLOSS, Grep for Log on Open Source Systems
#
# This file defines plugin information for GLOSS that enables it to make
# good use of the structured information in the log files of Postfix.
# It will be incredibly useful to see queue ids, email addresses and
# mail server hostnames and even their IP addresses turn into links.
# This would be established with HTML encoding for HTTP mode.
